👋 Hi, I’m Caitlin!

I have experience in scientific research (studying muscle contraction in McGill University biophysics lab) and operational safety (applying lean six sigma and product management to build programs and products that improve safety at Amazon).
I'm currently focused on leveraging machine learning and deep learning to build exciting products and deliver insightful findings!

- 👀 I’m interested in building programs with core data science (machine learning / deep learning) functionality.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud engineering automation and building on top of powerful open source deep learning models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on health-driven data products and research that benefits from big data methods!

If any of these things resonate with you - let's connect!
